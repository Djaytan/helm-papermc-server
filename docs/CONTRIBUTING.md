## 🌱 How to Contribute

A contribution can be as simple as opening a discussion or reporting us an issue, an idea of enhancement or a code improvement.

No matter of your capabilities or how important is your wish to contribute to this project, your help will be welcome and very appreciated!

### 💭 Discussions

Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like to help troubleshooting a PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've experimented with our product,
join us in [discussions](https://github.com/Djaytan/helm-papermc-server/discussions).

### 🐛 Issues

[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with.
If an issue doesn't have any label, this means we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin to work on it.

If you've found a bug, a weird behavior or an exploit, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing.
If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/Djaytan/helm-papermc-server/issues/new/choose).
We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to be fixed.

### 🛠️ Pull Requests

A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes in our
repository.
When we merge those changes, they would be deployed in the next release by the maintainer. 🌍

If this is your first pull request (PR), we recommend you to get familiar with the process through
this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).

When considering contributing to the project through PRs, please follow these guidelines:

1. Try to open several smaller PRs instead of only a big one, it will make the job of the reviewers easier.
2. Give a summary of the changes provided by your PR.
   Link any related issue, discussion or documentation that could help the reviewer understand your work, the impacts and the plus-value.
3. You will need at least one approval of a reviewer before being able to merge the PR.
4. All automatic jobs must pass (GitHub Actions, security scans, formatting verification, ...) before merging.

### ❓ Support

Asking questions is a way for you to be unblocked, and by doing so, this could help other people too if they are interested in the answer!
Thus, the best place for asking support is under [discussions](https://github.com/Djaytan/helm-papermc-server/discussions).

Furthermore, rest assured that the community will try to find the best way to help you! ✨
